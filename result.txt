ABSTRACT  The article discusses the legislative regulation of digital products based on distributed registry technology -  the blockchain. In particular, much attention is paid to the legal regulation of the issue, storage, exchange,  purchase and sale of cryptocurrency. The study is based on a modern scientific methodology, including the  doctrinal method, systematic approach and legal cybernetics, analysis of legislation and a comparative  approach, legal statistics, legal forecasting. The novelty is the development, based on the systematization of  foreign experience, regarding universal approaches to the legal regulation of mining and the cryptocurrency  market. The specific problems of each sector of the activity on the issue and use of cryptocurrencies, as well  as the main risks, were identified. The result of the study includes the identification of key aspects of the legal  regulation of cryptocurrencies in different jurisdictions; determination of the content of the mechanism of  their legal regulation; proposals regarding changes in domestic legislation on the regulation of mining and the  cryptocurrency market. The content of digital law as a new emerging sub-sector is indicated. Сonclusions are  drawn about the need for a legislative framework for the functioning of the digital market, including the  cryptocurrency business. According to the authors, this is fundamentally important for full-fledged market  integration in the global economic space, as well as the formation of a framework for the uniformity of digital  law at the level of different jurisdictions.  Keywords: digital law, cryptocurrency, blockchain, legal regulation  1. INTRODUCTION  New types of social relations objectively appear in  connection with global scientific and technological  development. Information technologies penetrate into all  spheres of public relations, transforming processes and  procedures, which necessitates the harmonization of legal  regulation, the formation of digital law, in general.  Cryptocurrency as an object of law for Russia is a new  phenomenon.  1.1. Related Work  There are no grounds for legal equating cryptocurrencies  with existing objects of legal regulation. There have been  many discussions earlier about the similarity of  cryptocurrency with securities, goods, money, precious  metals, but it does not fully fit into any legal construction  related to other property.  Cryptocurrency is a special and specific object of law, and  the absence of unambiguous legal norms significantly  reduces, on the one hand, its investment attractiveness, and  on the other hand, creates legal conflicts.  One of the key issues, in our opinion, is the legal regime  for mining and storing cryptocurrencies in the virtual  space, their circulation and use as a means of payment.  The legal regulation of mining and the activities of mining  farms in the Russian legal field is uncertain, there are also  no legally fixed concepts of “mining”, “cryptocurrency”,  “cryptocurrency market”, “digital transaction  (transaction)”.  1.1.1. Manual interactive assumption generation  The digital transformation of the public, real and financial  sectors determines the inevitability of changes in the  mechanism of their legal regulation, the revision of legal  techniques and technologies. In the global dimension, the  rapidly growing ICT capabilities that allow creating and  using network effects are ahead of the legal interpretation  of digital actions and the definition of criteria for their  compliance [1]. New mature start-ups appear in the  cryptocurrency segment, digital products are offered on  cryptocurrency exchanges that are gaining increasing  market shares, thereby forming a new industry of crypto  services, but which falls into a “legal vacuum” on many  issues [2].

Features of the Ethereum  protocol significantly expanded the functions of  cryptocurrencies and gave a new round to the development  of the entire crypto economy. Now you can create "addons" on top of the blockchain, the functioning of which  takes place on the ETH blockchain. The purpose of the  "add-ons" is different, for example, the release of their  own cryptocurrencies or the creation of decentralized  applications. Thus, cryptocurrencies appeared serving the  blockchain platform for creating decentralized  applications. In them, cryptocurrencies are technical units  of account for ensuring the movement of information [3].  At the turn of 2018-2019, in a global context, there was a  trend towards the development of legislation in order to  integrate cryptocurrency exchanges into the existing  financial system, to simplify transactions in  cryptocurrencies for legal entities and individuals,  exchanging them for fiat money. This is due, inter alia, to  the development and adoption of AML / CFT standards in  the implementation of financial measures to combat  money laundering.  According to the recommendations of the FATF, when  assessing the possibility of illegal actions with virtual  digital assets, countries should proceed from a risk-based  approach, which consists in requiring virtual asset service  providers to identify, evaluate, apply effective measures to  minimize the risks of money laundering and terrorist  financing. The need to license or register virtual asset  service providers in at least the jurisdictions that are  created.  1.1.2. Problems of Legal Regulation of  cryptocurrency  Regulation of the issue and circulation of cryptocurrency,  as noted in the review of the Bank of Russia, should  include measures, in particular: registration (licensing) of  exchange sites; user identification by AML / CFT; taxation  of cryptocurrency turnover participants; reporting on sites;  establishing minimum capital requirements for exchange  sites; consumer rights Protection; responsibility for  violation of established requirements [4]. The positive  aspects of cryptocurrency regulation are: firstly, statistical  information on the use of cryptographic currencies, on the  basis of which the practice of its application is monitored;  secondly, for the purposes of AML / CFT [5] control of  operations with cryptocurrency and their identification;  thirdly, the possibility of introducing restrictions on the  volume and list of operations with cryptocurrency; fourth,  arbitration and liability.  Applying, by analogy, the existing norms of Russian civil  law, we can talk about cryptocurrency mining in the  context of Art. 137 of the Civil Code of the Russian  Federation - as about obtaining fruits, products or income  from the use of a thing (miner). ” Mining is a contract. A  suitable analogue under Russian law may be a public  contract (Article 426 of the Civil Code of the Russian  Federation). Under the terms of the contract, the system  (the community of all participants in the blockchain) pays  a certain amount of remuneration in the form of  cryptocurrency to any person fulfilling the technical  conditions (mining). Obtaining cryptocurrency as a result  of mining, in fact, is the same as receiving fiat money for  performing any services, work, or any other conditions.  Acceptance is carried out at the expense of opportunistic  actions (carried out "automatically"). Persons who are not  engaged in mining, but register a "wallet", also join the  contract (Article 428 of the Civil Code of the Russian  Federation). The question of the legal nature of the  remuneration itself is also a topic of controversial  discussion and interpretation.  From the technical aspects, mining is a method of mining  cryptocurrency, which is based on solving mathematical  problems using powerful computers, through a special  program (miner), followed by decryption of the next block  of the chain, to receive rewards in the form of  corresponding digital coins, and crediting them to the  address wallet or account. This Bitcoin wallet address can  be “cold” stored on a computer, a “hot” online wallet, or a  crypto exchange wallet. The features of distributed  databases that allow you to create a new generation of  electronic money, as you know, are decentralization and  anonymity.  Depending on the demand for cryptocurrency and the  difficulty of producing new “coins,” during forking,  forking is carried out on copies of bitcoin or new  cryptocurrencies when a different exchange rate is set  depending on the rate of issue or hashing. Hard forks,  cardinal separation of the network and transformation of  the algorithm by updating the Bitcoin network are  possible, which leads to the reorganization of the  blockchain or the emergence of a competing blockchain.  1.1.2.1. Private and Public Blockchain.  The blockchain industry, in general, is characterized by  extremely high dynamism, it affects the value of individual  assets and the functioning of the crypto market as a whole,  but the main transactions are with Bitcioin and Ethereum  [6].  According to experts of Russian mining [7], mining on our  own equipment, working with cloud mining services is  technically simpler. The creation of mining data centers  and downloads occur gradually, part of the area is loaded  by own miners, and part is given for hosting. Thus, the  business gets the opportunity to quickly return  investments, diversify risk / Bitcoin mining is currently the  most widespread, however, other cryptocurrencies  (altcoins) are increasingly involved in the issue and  turnover, and also go to the ICO (Initial Coin Offering)  crypto-exchanges / Despite regulatory uncertainty and  pronounced market volatility, digital token sales have  become an important activity in the capital markets over  the years.  Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research, volume 498  87  According to some estimates, token sales compete with  traditional IPOs and venture capital markets. According to  a leading expert in the field of digital assets, K. Lewis,  “the risk of a violation created by blockchain technology  for the existing regulatory framework may be less  dramatic than its ability to violate the entrenched interests  of traditional market participants (for example, securities)”  [8].  Rapid development in the global economy is receiving  distributed registry technology - the blockchain, which is  relatively new to Russian practice. The legal attitude of  blockchain projects is debatable by lawyers, at the same  time there is a contradiction, legal risks and illegitimacy of  decisions on blockchain projects (including the issue and  sale of cryptocurrency) are due to the lack of legal  regulation. The lack of uniform standards and legal  regulation leads to legal, technical and financial  inconsistency among stakeholders, the implementation of  the norm will occur gradually. From the point of view of  Arslanov K.M., the reform of the legal institution of  blockchain relations presupposes an already more or less  solid legal basis for the corresponding legal structure [9].  2. RESULTS  Based on the context, blockchain is seen as a technology, a  distributed decentralized registry-protocol of interaction.  Cryptocurrencies do not need banking intermediation due  to the use of blockchain technology. Using the blockchain,  there is no need for a server or a central authorized body,  which can significantly reduce the cost of physical values  carriers. The main difference between public and private  blockchains is the level of access that is granted to  participants. For complete decentralization, public  blockchains are completely open. Anyone can participate  by adding or checking data. The most common examples  of a public blockchain are Bitcoins (BTC) and Ethereum  (ETH). Both of these cryptocurrencies are created using  open source computer codes that can be viewed and used  by anyone.  Private blockchains are much more scalable, since only a  few nodes are authorized and responsible for data  management, so the network is able to process more  transactions. Decision making is much faster due to  centralization. However, the centralization of the private  blockchain is one of its biggest weaknesses. The  blockchain was introduced to eliminate centralization, and  the private blockchain contradicts this.  Trust in a private blockchain network depends on trust in  authorized sites. They must be trustworthy as they verify  transactions. The validity of the records also cannot be  independently verified. Security is another issue with a  private blockchain. With fewer hosts, it is easier for  attackers to gain control of the network. Unfortunately, a  private blockchain is more at risk of hacking or data  manipulation.  Blockchain as an implementation option of a network of  distributed registries contains information about digital  actions (actions in the digital space), which are grouped in  accordance with one or another criterion. Thus, the scope  of the blockchain in the part of the distributed registry is  very wide: the financial sector, the banking sector,  education, international trade and logistics, marketing and  building business models, politics and sociology,  personnel management and management, electronic  platforms, energy, customs, transport and navigation,  development and construction, ecology and nature  management, crime prevention in various fields,  intellectual property management and copyright  protection, etc. [10].  Until recently, blockchain was an innovation known to a  narrow circle of specialists in several countries, and now  this technology is relevant for the global economy. In  some countries, such as Venezuela, virtual currency plays  an important role even in the everyday life of ordinary  citizens. In the Republic of Belarus, cryptocurrencies  participate in civil circulation, are alienated and transferred  to another entity, i.e. under republican law,  cryptocurrencies do not apply to intangible goods that are  inalienable and non-transferable.  Although blockchain plays a much more prominent role in  society, it remains a relatively nascent technology that has  existed for less than 10 years. The issue of blockchain  regulation arose precisely because technology began to  penetrate actively into those areas of the economy where  intensive regulation, financing, investment, raising capital  and transactions, and money transfer have developed.  We note the main advantages of distributed registry  technology: the novelty of information encryption  methods; mutual authentication of information by the  parties; smart contracts; universality of information  sources, relevance and completeness of data; data set  uniformity; distributed records; reduction of information  risks; making transactions in real time [11, 12].  Blockchain security is provided cryptographically. An  important issue in the practical use of blockchain, and  distributed ledger technology, in general, is the effective  management of cryptographic keys for accessing data.  Loss and disclosure of keys can lead to irretrievable  financial losses, losses due to gaining access to  information. The confidentiality of private keys is  required, including ensuring the reliability of algorithms  and protocols for creating, storing, distributing, revoking,  or destroying keys.  Also, a difficult question arises of the volume, content and  accuracy of the information that is made available to  contractors. Ensuring compliance with data privacy  regulations is necessary. Participants must agree on the  level and extent of data provision. Distributed storage of  information involves copies of the distributed registry on  each node - a member of the network, and this can make it  difficult to ensure the confidentiality of stored data and  access control for different network participants.  There are no direct prohibitions on the use of technology  of distributed ledgers in Russian legislation; general norms  of the law apply to its use in the financial sector, including  requirements for identifying customers, protecting  personal data and confidential information, and ensuring  consumer rights.  Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research, volume 498  88  Attempts to unify the practice of regulating the blockchain  are not possible, since in some countries technology is  being stimulated, and in others, on the contrary, they are  trying to eliminate it from their jurisdiction. This leads to  the absence or limitation of commercial blockchain  solutions, but one should not exaggerate the widespread  use of blockchain technology.  According to the unanimous opinion of the specialists of  the Blockchain Alliance [13], the bitcoin transaction is not  anonymous, as is debatably reflected in many works and  positions. Law enforcement agencies around the world are  now striving to “monitor digital money.” Having a  generally accessible, traceable, unchanging, limitless  register of every bitcoin transaction ever conducted allows  law enforcement agencies to track the flow of funds  related to the purpose of an investigation anywhere in the  world. These same tools allow cryptocurrency exchanges  to better identify suspicious participants and transactions,  in accordance with the requirements for combating money  laundering.  As blockchain technology improves, it will be extremely  difficult to use cryptocurrencies for criminal purposes.  According to the experience of the Blockchain Alliance,  mutual cooperation with industrial communities, unions,  enterprises is necessary in terms of promoting lawmaking  and joint development of rules to realize the full positive  potential of blockchain technology. This is crucial for the  growth of the economy and the industrial sector,  harmonization of legislation in accordance with the  objectives of innovative technological development [14,  15].  The development of new technological solutions actualizes  the problem of intellectual property. When implementing  the blockchain, it is also necessary to comply with antitrust  laws and competition principles. The exchange of specific  data on current and future prices and competitive activity,  in contrast to aggregated past information (before using  the blockchain), can lead to the improvement of antitrust  laws.  The experience of the European Union in the field of  regulation of operations using distributed registry  technology is of methodological and practical interest. The  European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA), which is  the main regulator for all national securities commissions  in Europe, issued a discussion paper in June 2016 entitled  “Application of technology” a distributed registry for  securities markets, which outlined the potential risks and  benefits that DLT may have in securities markets,  especially in terms of public policy.  The growing popularity of blockchain technology and the  growing demand of European Union banks for digital  money (in late 2019, more than 40 licensed German banks  turned to the German Federal Financial Supervisory  Authority Bafin with a request to allow Bitcoin  transactions) contributed to the adoption of the fifth EU  directive, according to which financial institutions have  the right to carry out operations with digital coins subject  to compliance with measures to combat money laundering  and the financing of terrorism.  It is obvious that regulators will continue to closely  monitor the development and use of distributed registry  technology in the regulated field. Previously, they tried to  get away from regulating technologies as such and paid  more attention to their use and products that can be  promoted or developed on a technology platform.  While the market keeps track of potential regulatory  developments, good governance is a key to successfully  implementing DLT to protect participants, investors, and  stakeholders, while ensuring the system’s resilience to  systemic risks, privacy issues, and cybersecurity threats.  The direction of development of the normative approach is  still not clear, but, in general, the industry must monitor  applications to which the blockchain can be applied, avoid  products and processes that are unlawful or lead to  systemic risks. In contrast, tight regulation is expected to  limit the future development of blockchain technology and  the benefits it can provide.  Blockchain technology as such probably does not need a  separate legal regulation, but a legal framework is needed  for legal actions, including cryptocurrency transactions. In  addition, an opinion is expressed on the appropriateness of  standardizing the architecture and ontology of distributed  registry technologies, its scope, fixing the requirements for  software and hardware, software for distributed registry  technologies, their security and confidentiality. Products  created on blockchain technology are information systems,  with the spread of the norms of Federal Law No. 149-ФЗ  dated June 27, 2006 "On Information, Information  Technologies and the Protection of Information".  There is no systematic judicial practice for registering  blockchain registry entries. A record in the blockchain  (transaction) is included in the block of the digital chain  after the identification of the hash signature selected  during the mining process. A transaction signed by a hash  block from a legal position is an electronic document that  may be written evidence for a court  3. CONCLUSION  Thus, it is necessary to comprehensively approach the  introduction of blockchain technology everywhere to study  its advantages, disadvantages and limitations. Of course, it  forms the basis for cybersecurity, protecting user data, and  is also aimed at streamlining processes through smart  contracts.  At the same time, the creation of a domestic regulatory  framework in the field of regulating the relations of  subjects of Internet entrepreneurship, the issue and  circulation of digital financial assets, is objectively  necessary. Legalization will solve the problems of  cryptocurrency market control. The development of  distributed ledger technology in the financial instrument  segment is rapid, which implies a corresponding  synchronization of legal regulatory and technical and  economic organizational aspects. Legislative regulation of  blockchain technology as a repository of documents, a  secure registry, maintaining registries, inventory and  Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research, volume 498  89  exchange of digital assets will provide formal protection  for the rights and interests of digital business.  In our opinion, the existence of a legislative framework for  the functioning of the digital market, in particular, the  cryptocurrency business, is fundamentally important for  full-fledged market integration in the global economic  space, as well as the formation of a framework for the  uniformity of digital law at the level of different  jurisdictions.
